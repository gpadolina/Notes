# NumPy

NumPy library provides the ndarray object for efficient storage and manipulation of homogenous(the same type) multidimensional 
dense data arrays in Python.

  ```
  import numpy as np
  ```

## The NumPy ndarray

Arrays enable you to perform mathematical operations on whole blocks of data using similar syntax to the equivalent operations between
scalar elements:

| Syntax | Description|
| --- | --- |
| np.shape | Indicates the size of each dimension |
