Random forest is another powerful non-parametric algorithm. It is an example of an ensemble method that relies on aggregating the results of
an ensemble of simpler estimators.

## Decision Trees
Extremely intuite ways to classify or label objects by simply asking a series of questions designed to zero in on the classification.
In a well-constructed tree, each question will cut the number of options by approximately half, very quickly narrowing the options even
among a large numbers of classes.
