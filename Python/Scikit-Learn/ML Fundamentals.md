* *Training Set* - The examples that the system uses to learn.
* *Sample* - Each training example is called sample (or training instance).
* *Data mining* - The application of ML techniques to dig into large amounts of data to discover patterns that 
were not immediately apparent.
* *Types of Machine Learning Systems*
  * *Supervised learning* - The training data included the desired solutions, called *labels*. Typical supervised learning task are
  classification and regression.
    * k-Nearest Neighbors
    * Linear Regression
    * Logistic Regression
    * Support Vector Machines (SVMs)
    * Decision Trees and Random Forests
    * Neural Network
  * *Unsupervised learning* - The training data is unlabeled.
    * k-Means
    * Hierarchical Cluster Analysis (HCA)
    * Expectation Maximization
    * Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
    * Kernel PCA
    * Locally-Linear Embedding (LLE)
    * t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE)
  * *Semisupervised learning* - Partially labeled training data, usually a lot of unlabeled data and a little bit of labeled data.
  * *Reinforcement learning* - The learning system, called an *agent*, can observe the environment, select and perform actions and get
  *rewards* in return or *penalties* in the form of negative rewards. It must learn by itself what is the best strategy called a *policy*.
* *Dimensionality Reduction* - Simplify the data without losing too much information by merging several correlated features into one.
* *Feature Extraction* - The dimensionality reduction algorithm will  merge features into one.
